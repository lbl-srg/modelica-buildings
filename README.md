# Modelica Buildings library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings)

This is the development site for the Modelica _Buildings_ library and its user guide.

Stable releases including all previous releases are available from the main project site
at http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica.

Instructions for developers are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/wiki).

## Library description

The Modelica Buildings library is a free open-source library with dynamic simulation models for building energy and control systems. The library contains models for

- HVAC systems,
- energy storage,
- controls, including a reference implementation of ASHRAE Standard 231P,
- heat transfer among rooms and the outside, either
  - natively in Modelica with a detailed or a reduced order model, or
  - integrated run-time coupling with EnergyPlus, aka, Spawn of EnergyPlus
- multizone airflow, including natural ventilation and contaminant transport,
- single-zone computational fluid dynamics coupled to heat transfer and HVAC systems,
- data-driven load prediction for demand response applications, and
- electrical DC and AC systems with two- or three-phases that can be balanced and unbalanced.


The main project site is http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica.

## Building binaries

The distribution at https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/download.html
contains all binaries.

Developers may build the binaries as follows.

### Spawn of EnergyPlus

The Buildings library already contains the compiled binaries that are needed to link to EnergyPlus.

To rebuild the Spawn of EnergyPlus binaries, CMake is required. The binaries
consist of the fmi-library, and a library that connects Modelica to EnergyPlus.

To build the fmi-library, which is only needed if https://github.com/modelon-community/fmi-library is updated, run
```
cd Buildings/Resources/src/fmi-library
rm -rf build && mkdir build && \
  cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . && \
  cd .. && rm -rf build
```

To build the Modelica to EnergyPlus library, run
```
cd modelica-buildings
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && \
  cmake ../ && cmake --build . --target install && \
  cd .. && rm -rf build
```

To install the EnergyPlus binaries for the Spawn interface for the current operating system, run
```
Buildings/Resources/src/ThermalZones/install.py --binaries-for-os-only
```
To install the binaries for all operating systems, omit the flag `--binaries-for-os-only`
