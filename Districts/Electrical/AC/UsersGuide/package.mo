<p>
The library 
<a href=\"modelica://Districts.Electrical.AC\">Districts.Electrical.AC</a>
models alternate current electrical systems. The frequency is modeled as quasi-stationary,
assuming a perfect sine wave with no higher harmonics.
</p>
<p>
Models in this library augment the model that are available in the package
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Electrical.QuasiStationary\">
Modelica.Electrical.QuasiStationary</a>, and
are fully compatible with these models.
The user's guide of the above library, which can be obtained at
<a href=\"modelica://Modelica.Electrical.QuasiStationary.UsersGuide\">
Modelica.Electrical.QuasiStationary.UsersGuide</a>,
gives an overview of
how alternating current systems are modeled as quasi-stationary systems.
It also gives an introduction to phasors which are used to model voltage, current and power.
