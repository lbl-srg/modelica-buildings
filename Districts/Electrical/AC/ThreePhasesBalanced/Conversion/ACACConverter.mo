  annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
This is an AC AC converter, based on a power balance between both QS circuit sides.
The paramater <i>conversionFactor</i> defines the ratio between averaged the QS rms voltages.
The loss of the converter is proportional to the power transmitted at the second circuit side.
The parameter <code>eps</code> is the efficiency of the transfer.
The loss is computed as
<i>P<sub>loss</sub> = (1-&eta;) |P<sub>DC</sub>|</i>,
where <i>|P<sub>DC</sub>|</i> is the power transmitted on the second circuit side.
Furthermore, reactive power on both QS side are set to 0.
