<p>
The <code>Buildings</code> library is a free open-source library for modeling of building energy and control systems. 
Many models are based on models from the package
<A HREF="../../msl/3.2/help/Modelica_Fluid.html#Modelica.Fluid"
>Modelica.Fluid</a> and use
the same ports to ensure compatibility with models from that library.
</p>
<p>
The web page for this library is
<a href="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica">http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica</a>. 
We welcome contributions from different users to further advance this library, 
whether it is through collaborative model development, through model use and testing
or through requirements definition or by providing feedback regarding the model applicability
to solve specific problems.
</p>
<p>
The library has the following <i>User's Guides</i>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
General information about the use of the <code>Buildings</code> library
is available at
<a href="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/userGuide">
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/userGuide</a>.
This web site covers general information that is not specific to the 
use of individual sublibraries or models.
Discussed topics include 
how to get started, best practices, how to post-process results using Python,
work-around for problems and how to develop models.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Some of the main sublibraries have their own
User's Guides that can be accessed by the links below.
These User's Guides are discussing items that are specific to the
individual libraries.<br/>

<P></P><H3>Information</H3>

<p>
This library follows the conventions of the 
<A HREF="../../msl/3.2/help/Modelica_UsersGuide_Conventions.html#Modelica.UsersGuide.Conventions"
>Modelica Standard Library</a>, which are as follows:
</p>

<p>
Note, in the html documentation of any Modelica library,
the headings "h1, h2, h3" should not be used,
because they are utilized from the automatically generated documentation/headings.
Additional headings in the html documentation should start with "h4".
</p>

<p>
In the Modelica package the following conventions are used:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Class and instance names are written in upper and lower case
  letters, e.g., "ElectricCurrent". An underscore is only used
  at the end of a name to characterize a lower or upper index,
  e.g., "pin_a".</li>

<li> <b>Class names</b> start always with an upper case letter.</li>

<li> <b>Instance names</b>, i.e., names of component instances and
  of variables (with the exception of constants),
  start usually with a lower case letter with only
  a few exceptions if this is common sense
  (such as "T" for a temperature variable).</li>

<li> <b>Constant names</b>, i.e., names of variables declared with the
  "constant" prefix, follow the usual naming conventions
  (= upper and lower case letters) and start usually with an
  upper case letter, e.g. UniformGravity, SteadyState.</li>
<li> The two connectors of a domain that have identical declarations
  and different icons are usually distinguished by "_a", "_b"
  or "_p", "_n", e.g., Flange_a/Flange_b, HeatPort_a, HeatPort_b.</li>

<li> The <b>instance name</b> of a component is always displayed in its icon
  (= text string "%name") in <b>blue color</b>. A connector class has the instance
  name definition in the diagram layer and not in the icon layer.
  <b>Parameter</b> values, e.g., resistance, mass, gear ratio, are displayed
  in the icon in <b>black color</b> in a smaller font size as the instance name.
 </li>

<li> A main package has usually the following subpackages:
  <ul>
  <li><b>UsersGuide</b> containing an overall description of the library
   and how to use it.</li>
  <li><b>Examples</b> containing models demonstrating the
   usage of the library.</li>
  <li><b>Interfaces</b> containing connectors and partial
   models.</li>
  <li><b>Types</b> containing type, enumeration and choice
   definitions.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The <code>Buildings</code> library uses the following conventions
in addition to the ones of the Modelica Standard Library:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The nomenclature used in the package
<A HREF="Buildings_Utilities_Psychrometrics.html#Buildings.Utilities.Psychrometrics"
>
Buildings.Utilities.Psychrometrics</a>
 is as follows, 
<ul>
<li>
Uppercase <code>X</code> denotes mass fraction per total mass.
</li>
<li>
Lowercase <code>x</code> denotes mass fraction per mass of dry air.
</li>
<li>
The notation <code>z_xy</code> denotes that the function or block has output
<code>z</code> and inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
</li>
<li>
The symbol <code>pW</code> denotes water vapor pressure, <code>TDewPoi</code> 
denotes dew point temperature, <code>TWetBul</code> denotes wet bulb temperature,
and <code>TDryBul</code> (or simply <code>T</code>) denotes dry bulb temperature.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Names of models, blocks and packages should start with an upper-case letter and be a
noun or a noun with a combination of adjectives and nouns.
Use camel-case notation to combine multiple words, such as <code>HeatTransfer</code>.
</li>
<li>
Parameter and variables names are usually a character, such as <code>T</code>
for temperature and <code>p</code> for pressure, or a combination of the first three
characters of a word, such as <code>higPreSetPoi</code> for high pressure set point.
</li>
<li>
Comments should be added to each class (package, model, function etc.).
The first character should be upper case.
For one-line comments of parameters, variables and classes, no period should be used at the end of the comment.
</li>
<li>
Where applicable, all variable must have units, also if the variable is protected.
</li>
<li>
To indicate that a class (i.e., a package, model, block etc.) has not been extensively tested or validated,
its class name ends with the string <code>Beta</code>.
</li>

</p>

<h4>7. Exclusions from License Grant</h4>
<p>
Neither the names of Licensor (including, but not limited to, University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Energy, UC, LBNL, LBL, and DOE), nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this License and in particular in Sections 2 and 5, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property, and no patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims. 
No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such trademarks are included in the Original Work, except as expressly stated in this License. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
</p>

<h4>8. Attribution Rights</h4>
<p>
You must retain in the Source Code of the Original Work and of any Derivative Works that You create, all author, copyright, patent, or trademark notices, as well as any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice". The same applies to the licensing notice of this License in the Original Work. For the matter of clarity, "author notice" means the notice that identifies the original author(s).
</p>
<p>
You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. 
</p>
<p>
In case the Original Work or Derivative Work is not provided in Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be appropriately displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative Work.
</p>

<h4>9. Disclaimer of Warranty</h4>
<p>
<u><strong>The Original Work is provided under this License on an "as is" basis and without warranty, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality of the Original Work is with You.</strong></u> This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.
</p>

<h4>10. Limitation of Liability</h4>
<p>
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor, the owner or a licensee of the Original Work be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, general, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. 
</p>

<h4>11. Termination</h4>
<p>
This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 2 and 5, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without observing these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations. This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to observe the conditions of this license. 
</p>

<h4>12. Termination for Patent Action</h4>
<p>
This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor, any owners of the Original Work or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement through combinations of the Original Work under combination with other software or hardware.
</p>

<h4>13. Jurisdiction</h4>
<p>
Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 
</p>

<h4>14. Attorneys' Fees</h4>
<p>
In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 
</p>

<li>If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

</li><li>
You are under no obligation whatsoever to provide any bug fixes, patches, or upgrades to the features, functionality or performance of the source code ("Enhancements") to anyone; however, if you choose to make your Enhancements available either publicly, or directly to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, without imposing a separate written license agreement for such Enhancements, then you hereby grant the following license: a non-exclusive, royalty-free perpetual license to install, use, modify, prepare derivative works, incorporate into other computer software, distribute, and sublicense such enhancements or derivative works thereof, in binary and source code form.
