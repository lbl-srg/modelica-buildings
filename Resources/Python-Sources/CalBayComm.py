''' GeneralCalBayComm.py

    Script that communicates with CalBay adapter to control lights.

    This script was written to interface with a simulation program. 
    Input to the script is a dimming light control signal, which 
    CalBay sends to the lights.
    Next, the script reads from CalBay the light level in the space, and
    sends that information back to the simulation program.

    This script is not yet finalized because the application programming 
    interface for data exchange with the CalBay adaptor of FLEXLAB has 
    not yet been finalized. 
    The script works, however, with the CalBay infrastructure as of 
    October 2013.

        The output from this function is the current light level in 4126F.
        The light level is read from the CalBay adapter.

        This function uses commands SETDAQ and GetDAQ. 
        Several other commands are available. The ones that are most useful are likely to be:
     
         * "REQCHAN:(USER):(PASS)" 
           This command returns all of the communication channels available to the user.
         * "GETDAQ:(SYS.CHAN):(USER):(PASS)" 
           This command reads a value from the requested channel.
         * "SETDAQ:(SYS.CHAN):(VALUE):(USER):(PASS)" 
           This command sets a control point to the value specified by the user.
