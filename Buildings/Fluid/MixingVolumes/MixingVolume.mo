Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
This model represents an instantaneously mixed volume.
Potential and kinetic energy at the port are neglected,
and there is no pressure drop at the ports.
The volume can exchange heat through its <code>heatPort</code>.
</p>
<p>
The volume can be parameterized as a steady-state model or as
dynamic model.</p>
<p>
To increase the numerical robustness of the model, the constant
<code>prescribedHeatFlowRate</code> can be set by the user.
This constant only has an effect if the model has exactly two fluid ports connected,
and if it is used as a steady-state model.
Use the following settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>prescribedHeatFlowRate=true</code> if the <i>only</i> means of heat transfer
at the <code>heatPort</code> is a prescribed heat flow rate that
is <i>not</i> a function of the temperature difference
between the medium and an ambient temperature. Examples include an ideal electrical heater,
a pump that rejects heat into the fluid stream, or a chiller that removes heat based on a performance curve.
If the <code>heatPort</code> is not connected, then set <code>prescribedHeatFlowRate=true</code> as
in this case, <code>heatPort.Q_flow=0</code>.
</li>
<li>Set <code>prescribedHeatFlowRate=false</code> if there is heat flow at the <code>heatPort</code>
computed as <i>K * (T-heatPort.T)</i>, for some temperature <i>T</i> and some conductance <i>K</i>,
which may itself be a function of temperature or mass flow rate.<br/>
If there is a combination of <i>K * (T-heatPort.T)</i> and a prescribed heat flow rate,
for example a solar collector that dissipates heat to the ambient and receives heat from
the solar radiation, then set <code>prescribedHeatFlowRate=false</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Options</h4>
<p>
The parameter <code>mSenFac</code> can be used to increase the thermal mass of this model
without increasing its volume. This way, species concentrations are still calculated
correctly even though the thermal mass increases. The additional thermal mass is calculated
based on the density and the value of the function <code>HeatCapacityCp</code>
of the medium state <code>state_default</code>. <br/>
This parameter can for instance be useful in a pipe model when the developer wants to
lump the pipe thermal mass to the fluid volume. By default <code>mSenFac = 1</code>, hence
the mass is unchanged. For higher values of <code>mSenFac</code>, the mass will be scaled proportionally.
</p>
<p>
Set the parameter <code>use_C_flow = true</code> to enable an input connector for the trace substance flow rate.
This allows to directly add or subtract trace substances such as
CO2 to the volume.
See
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.Sensors.Examples.PPM\">Buildings.Fluid.Sensors.Examples.PPM</a>
for an example.
</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>
If the model is operated in steady-state and has two fluid ports connected,
then the same energy and mass balance implementation is used as in
steady-state component models, i.e., the use of <code>actualStream</code>
is not used for the properties at the port.
</p>
<p>
The implementation of these balance equations is done in the instances
<code>dynBal</code> for the dynamic balance and <code>steBal</code>
for the steady-state balance. Both models use the same input variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The variable <code>Q_flow</code> is used to add sensible <i>and</i> latent heat to the fluid.
For example, <code>Q_flow</code> participates in the steady-state energy balance<pre>
    port_b.h_outflow = inStream(port_a.h_outflow) + Q_flow * m_flowInv;
</pre>
where <code>m_flowInv</code> approximates the expression <code>1/m_flow</code>.
</li>
<li>
The variable <code>mXi_flow</code> is used to add a species mass flow rate to the fluid.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the rationale of selecting different energy and mass balances, and for the
use of <code>prescribedHeatFlowRate</code>, see the documentation of
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.MixingVolumes.BaseClasses.PartialMixingVolume\">
Buildings.Fluid.MixingVolumes.BaseClasses.PartialMixingVolume</a>.

Set <code>initialize_p</code> to <code>final</code> so that it does not

<ul>
<li>
Changed implementation of balance equation. The new implementation uses a different model if
exactly two fluid ports are connected, and in addition, the model is used as a steady-state
component. For this model configuration, the same balance equations are used as were used
for steady-state component models, i.e., instead of <code>actualStream(...)</code>, the
<code>inStream(...)</code> formulation is used.
This changed required the introduction of a new parameter <code>m_flow_nominal</code> which
is used for smoothing in the steady-state balance equations of the model with two fluid ports.
</li>
<li>
Another revision was the removal of the parameter <code>use_HeatTransfer</code> as there is
no noticeable overhead in always having the <code>heatPort</code> connector present.
