<p>
The package <code>Buildings.Fluid.Interface</code> consists of basic
classes that can be used by developers to create new component models.
</p>
<p>
The classes whose name contains <code>TwoPort</code> or
<code>FourPort</code> can be used for components with
two or four fluid ports, respectively. If a class name contains
<code>Static</code>, then it can only be used for a steady-state model.
Otherwise, it may be used for a steady-state or a dynamic model.
</p>
<p>
The most basic classes are the records
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.Interfaces.TwoPortFlowResistanceParameters\">
Buildings.Fluid.Interfaces.TwoPortFlowResistanceParameters</a>,
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.Interfaces.FourPortFlowResistanceParameters\">
Buildings.Fluid.Interfaces.FourPortFlowResistanceParameters</a> and
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.Interfaces.LumpedVolumeDeclarations\">
Buildings.Fluid.Interfaces.LumpedVolumeDeclarations</a>.
These define parameters that are needed by many fluid flow components.
</p>

<p>
Next, we describe the basic classes. For a more detailed description,
see the <i>info</i> section of the class.

      This is a basic model for an ideally mixed fluid volume.
      It implements conservation equations for mass and energy.
      The conservation equations can be dynamic or steady-state.
      The model can have an arbitrary number of fluid ports.
      Models that instanciate this model need to define the input
      <code>fluidVolume</code>, which is the actual volume occupied by the fluid.
      For most components, this can be set to a parameter. However, for components such as
      expansion vessels, the fluid volume can change in time.
      </p>

      The model has the following input connectors:<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Q_flow</code>, which is the sensible plus latent heat flow rate added to the medium, and
</li>
<li>
<code>mXi_flow</code>, which is the species mass flow rate added to the medium.
</li>
</ul>

  <p>
  Models that instanciate this model can used these connectors to interface with the conservation equations.

      for mass and energy of a component with two fluid ports.

  Compared to

      Buildings.Fluid.Interfaces.ConservationEquation</a>
  this model provides a more efficient implementation of the steady-state conservation equations for
  models with two fluid ports.

     This model defines the interface for component models that transport
     fluid, and that can exchange heat and mass.
     It also defines the port pressure difference as
     <i>&Delta;p = p<sub>a</sub>-p<sub>b</sub></i>. However, no equation is
     implemented to compute <i>&Delta;p(&sdot;)</i> as a function of the
     mass flow rate. The model also implements equations to obtain the
     thermodynamic state at the ports.

     This model implements the pressure drop as a function of the mass flow rate.
     It also implements the steady-state energy and mass conservation
     equations. However, it does not implement an equation that computes
     <code>Q_flow</code>, the
     sensible and latent heat transfer to the medium flow, nor
     does it implement an equation for <code>mXi_flow</code>,
     the species mass flow rate added to or removed from the medium.
     Models that extend this model need to provide equations
     for <code>Q_flow</code> and <code>mXi_flow</code>.
