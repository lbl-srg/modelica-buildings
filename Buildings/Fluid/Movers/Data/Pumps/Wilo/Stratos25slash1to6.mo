<p>
The nominal rpm is arbitrarily chosen as the rpm of the pump curve
in the data sheet that has the highest rpm,
without being limited by the maximum power limitation
(see dotted curve on figure below).
Pump curves (H(m_flow) and P(m_flow)) from the data sheets
are digitized using
<a href=\"http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/\">web plot digitizer</a>.
</p>
<h4>Limitations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The pump curve cap at high rpm that can be seen is not enforced
by the model.
</li>
<li>
The pump curve may be altered slightly to guarantee that <i>dp/dm&lt;0</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The figure below illustrates a digitized pump curve.
