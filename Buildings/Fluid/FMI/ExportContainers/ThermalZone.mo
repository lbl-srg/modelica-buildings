<p>
Model that is used as a container for a single thermal zone
that is to be exported as an FMU.
</p>
<h4>Typical use and important parameters</h4>
<p>
To use this model as a container for an FMU, extend
from this model, rather than instantiate it,
add your thermal zone and a vector of mass flow rate sensors.
By extending from this model, the top-level
signal connectors on the left stay at the top-level, and hence
will be visible at the FMI interface.
</p>

Note that
<ul>
<li>
The vector of mass flow rate sensors is used to connect
the thermal zone adapter and your thermal zone.
</li>
<li>
The vector of mass flow rate sensors must have the size <code>nPorts</code>.
</li>
<li>
All fluid ports of the mass flow rate sensor must be connected.
</li>
<li>
If the vector of mass flow rate sensors is not used, and your themal zone
has fluid ports which are autosized, then a direct connection between
the thermal zone adpater <code>theZonAda</code> and your thermal
zone will be rejected. The reason is because autosized fluid ports
can only be connected to vector of ports whose sizes are literal.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The example
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Examples.FMUs.ThermalZone\">
Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Examples.FMUs.ThermalZone</a>
shows how a simple thermal zone can be implemented and exported as
an FMU.
The example
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Validation.RoomHVAC\">
Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Validation.RoomHVAC</a>
shows how such an FMU can be connected
to an HVAC system that has signal flow.
</p>

<p>
The conversion between the fluid ports and signal ports is done
in the thermal zone adapter <code>theZonAda</code>.
This adapter has a vector of fluid ports called <code>ports[nPorts]</code>
which needs to be connected to the air volume of the thermal zone.
At this port, air exchanged between the thermal zone, the HVAC system
and any infiltration flow paths.
</p>
<p>
This model has input signals <code>fluPor[nPorts]</code>, which carry
the mass flow rate for each flow that is connected to <code>ports</code>, together with its
temperature, water vapor mass fraction per total mass of the air (not per kg dry
air), and trace substances. These quantities are always as if the flow
enters the room, even if the flow is zero or negative.
If a medium has no moisture, e.g., if <code>Medium.nXi=0</code>, or
if it has no trace substances, e.g., if <code>Medium.nC=0</code>, then
the output signal for these properties are removed.
Thus, a thermal zone model that uses these signals to compute the
heat added by the HVAC system need to implement an equation such as
</p>
<p align=\"center\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">
Q<sub>sen</sub> = max(0, &#7745;<sub>sup</sub>) &nbsp; c<sub>p</sub> &nbsp; (T<sub>sup</sub> - T<sub>air,zon</sub>),
</p>
<p>
where
<i>Q<sub>sen</sub></i> is the sensible heat flow rate added to the thermal zone,
<i>&#7745;<sub>sup</sub></i> is the supply air mass flow rate from
the port <code>fluPor</code> (which is negative if it is an exhaust),
<i>c<sub>p</sub></i> is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure,
<i>T<sub>sup</sub></i> is the supply air temperature and
<i>T<sub>air,zon</sub></i> is the zone air temperature.
Note that without the <i>max(&middot;, &middot;)</i>, the energy
balance would be wrong.
Models in the package
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed</a>
as well as the control volumes in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.MixingVolumes\">
Buildings.Fluid.MixingVolumes</a>
implement such a <i>max(&middot;, &middot;)</i> function.
</p>
<p>
The zone air temperature,
the water vapor mass fraction per total mass of the air (unless <code>Medium.nXi=0</code>)
and trace substances (unless <code>Medium.nC=0</code>)
can be obtained from the outupt connector
<code>fluPor.backward</code>.
These signals are the same as the inflowing fluid stream(s)
at the port <code>theAdaZon.ports[1:nPorts]</code>.
The fluid connector <code>ports[nPorts]</code> has a prescribed mass flow rate, but
it does not set any pressure.
</p>
<p>
This model has a user-defined parameter <code>nPorts</code>
which sets the number of fluid ports, which in turn is used
for the ports <code>fluPor</code> and <code>ports</code>.
All <code>nPorts</code>
<code>ports[1:nPorts]</code> need to be connected as demonstrated in the example
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Examples.FMUs.ThermalZone\">
Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Examples.FMUs.ThermalZone</a>.
</p>
<p>
The example
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Validation.RoomHVAC\">
Buildings.Fluid.FMI.ExportContainers.Validation.RoomHVAC</a>
shows conceptually how such an FMU can then be connected to a HVAC system
that has signal flow.
