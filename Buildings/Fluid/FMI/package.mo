<p>
This package contains blocks that serve as containers for exporting
models from <code>Buildings.Fluid</code> as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU).
</p>
<p>
This allows using models from <code>Buildings.Fluid</code>, add them
to a block that only has input and output signals, but no acausal connectors,
and then export the model as a Functional Mockup Unit.
Models can be individual models or systems that are composed of various
models.
For more information, see the
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.FMI.UsersGuide\">User's Guide</a>.
