Moved assignment of evaporator data <code>datCoi</code> from the
<code>constrainedBy</code> declaration in the base class
to the instantiation to work around a limitation of JModelica.

<p>
This model can be used to simulate a water-cooled DX cooling coil with multiple
operating stages. Depending on the used performance curves, each
stage could be a different compressor speed, or a different mode
of operation, such as with or without hot gas reheat.
