  annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
This package contains performance curves for the cooling capacity and the EIR
of DX cooling coils that are used in the examples.
</p>
<p>
For performance data of specific DX cooling coils, see the packages
<a href=\"Buildings.Fluid.HeatExchangers.DXCoils.Data.SingleSpeed\">
