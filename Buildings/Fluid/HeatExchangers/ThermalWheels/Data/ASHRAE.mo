ASHRAE performance dataset for the variable-speed wheel model.
</p>
<p>
It is developed based on Figure 7 in ASHRAE (2024).
However, the original data set was extrapolated to cover lower values
of speed ratio, i.e. <code> &lt;= 0.2</code>, by setting the heat exchange effectiveness
corrections to 0 when the speed ratio is 0.
