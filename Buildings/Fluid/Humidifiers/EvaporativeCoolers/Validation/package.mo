<p>This package contains models that validate the models in <a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.Humidifiers.EvaporativeCoolers\">Buildings.Fluid.Humidifiers.EvaporativeCoolers</a>. The examples plot various outputs, which have been verified against analytical solutions. These model outputs are stored as reference data to allow continuous validation whenever models in the library change. </p>
