!-   ===========  ALL OBJECTS IN CLASS: VERSION ===========
! Approximation of the HVAC systems for the testing rooms:
!   * Single fan single duct constant air volume system.
!   * Variable chilled water flow rate with a lower limit to approximate the minimum cold air flow.
!   * Maximum supply air is higher than that of a single fan air volume in real case to better match measured cooling load.
!   * Fan efficiency and pressure rise are tuned to better match measured cooling load.
!   * Fan motor is assumed to be out of the supply air stream in order not to conteminate the cooling load with inaccurate fan motor heat gain.
!   * Added a chilled bypass to account for additional amount of chilled water designed to cool three rooms.
! Approximation of lighting:
!   * Visible absorptances of surfaces are tuned such that the workplane illuminance in the middle of room matches the measured illuminance.
! Infiltration:
!   * Infiltration air flow rate is guessed as a small value.
