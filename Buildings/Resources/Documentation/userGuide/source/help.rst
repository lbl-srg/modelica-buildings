Before submitting a bug report,
 * check https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/issues if the bug is already known, and
 * make sure that it is a bug of the model and not the modeling or simulation environment.

When submitting a bug report, please provide:
 * A *total model* that is as small as possible and still reproduces the error. The chances of quickly finding and fixing a bug are much higher if the bug is part of a small test problem. In addition, creating a small test problem may help finding the root cause for the bug yourself, or realizing that there is no bug at all, and hence your problem can be solved much sooner. In Dymola, a *total model* can be saved by selecting ``File -> Save Total``.
 * A description of the expected and the observed results.
 * Information about the operating system and the used Modelica simulation environment.

To report the bug, enter a new issue at https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/issues
