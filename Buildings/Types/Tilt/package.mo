<p>
Possible constant values to define the tilt of a surface.
For example, for a construction that is a floor, use
<code>Buildings.Types.Tilt.Floor</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note that a ceiling has a tilt of <i>0</i>
, and also the solar collector models
in
<a href=\"Buildings.Fluid.SolarCollectors\">Buildings.Fluid.SolarCollectors</a>
require a tilt of <i>0</i>
if they are facing straight upwards.
This is correct because
the solar irradiation on a ceiling construction is on the other-side surface,
which faces upwards toward the sky. Hence, a construction is considered
a ceiling from the view point of a person standing inside a room.
