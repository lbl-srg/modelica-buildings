<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>
This package is a copy from the Modelica Standard Library (MSL) because
MSL 3.2 stores this package in 
<code>Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium.Choices</code>, whereas
MSL 3.2.1 stores it in
<code>Modelica.Media.Interfaces.Choices</code> because enumerations
cannot be done through a partial package.
The local copy has done to enable compatibility with both versions.
