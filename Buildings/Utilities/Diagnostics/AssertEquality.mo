<ul>
<li>
October 10, 2013, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Reformulated model to avoid an event iteration.
</li>
<li>
September 10, 2013, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Added <code>time</code> in print statement as OpenModelica,
in its error message, does not output the time when the assert is triggered.
</li>
<li>
January 23, 2013, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Replaced <code>when</code> test with <code>if</code> test as
equations within a <code>when</code> section are only evaluated
when the condition becomes true.
This fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/issues/72\">issue 72</a>.

<li>
April 17, 2008, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
First implementation.
