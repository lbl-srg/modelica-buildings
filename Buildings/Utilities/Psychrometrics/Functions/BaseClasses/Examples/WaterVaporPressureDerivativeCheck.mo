This example checks whether the function derivative
is implemented correctly. If the derivative implementation
is not correct, the model will stop with an assert statement.

Changed accuarcy test in assertion to use the relative error because the
magnitude of <code>y</code> is <i>1E5</i> and hence testing an absolute
error is too stringent.

Updated regression test to have slope that is different from one.
This is for
<a href=\"https://github.com/iea-annex60/modelica-annex60/issues/303\">issue 303</a>.

Added a high tolerance which is needed for OpenModelica to pass the assert
statement.
