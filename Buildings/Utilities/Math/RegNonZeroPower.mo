  annotation (Documentation(info="<html>

Function that approximates <i>y=|x|<sup>n</sup></i> where <i>n &gt; 0</i> 
so that
<ul>
<li><i>y(0)</i> is not equal to zero.
<li><i>dy/dx</i> is bounded and continuous everywhere.
</ul>

<p>
This function replaces <i>y=|x|<sup>n</sup></i> in the interval
<i>-&delta;...+&delta;</i> by a 4-th order polynomial that has the same
function value and the first and second derivative at <i>x=&plusmn; &delta;</i>.
</p>
<p>
A typical use of this function is to replace the 
function for the convective heat transfer
coefficient for forced or free convection that is of the form 
<i>h=c |dT|<sup>n</sup></i> for some constant <i>c</i> and exponent 
<i>0 &le; n &le; 1</i>. 
By using this function, the original function
that has an infinite derivative near zero and that takes on zero
at the origin is replaced by a function with a bounded derivative and 
a non-zero value at the origin. Physically, 
the region <i>-&delta;...+&delta;</i> may be interpreted as the region
where heat conduction dominates convection in the boundary layer.
