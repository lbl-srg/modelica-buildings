<h4>How is spawn invoked?</h4>
<p>
Modelica tries to invoke <code>spawn-0.3.0-0fa49be497[.exe]</code> in this order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
On Linux, it searches for
<pre>
Buildings[ x.y.z]/Resources/bin/spawn-0.3.0-0fa49be497/linux64/bin/spawn-0.3.0-0fa49be497

Buildings[ x.y.z]/Resources/bin/spawn-0.3.0-0fa49be497/win64/bin/spawn-0.3.0-0fa49be497.exe
</pre>
where <code>Buildings[ x.y.z]</code> is the installation folder of the Modelica Buildings Library.
This file is distributed with the Modelica Buildings Library installation,
together with all files needed to translate and simulate a model in a Modelica environment.

<h4>How to instantiate models for one or several buildings</h4>
<p>
To instantiate one or several building models, proceed as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Create an instance of
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Building\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Building</a> to specify the building model.
This instance is automatically named <code>building</code> and this
name must not be changed.
</li>
<li>
In the instance <code>building</code>, specify building-level parameters such as the
EnergyPlus input file name and weather file name.
</li>
<li>
For the weather file, both <code>.mos</code> and <code>.epw</code> files
must be specified.
The <code>.epw</code> file will be used by the EnergyPlus envelope model, and the <code>.mos</code>
file will be used by the Modelica model, and must be specified by the parameters <code>epwName</code>
and <code>weaName</code>
in the instance <code>building</code>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The following coupling objects can then be integrated in the model that contains the instance
<code>building</code>, or in any model instantiated by that model.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To connect Modelica zone models with the equivalent EnergyPlus zone envelopes,
instantiate any number of <a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone</a> models and parameterize them with the name
of the thermal zones as they are entered in the EnergyPlus input data file.
Each model should also be assigned the medium of heat transfer (typically air),
as is done for any other fluid flow component.
</li>
<li>
To write to EnergyPlus actuators or schedules during the simulation,
instantiate any number of
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Actuator\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Actuator</a>
or
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Schedule\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Schedule</a> models.
</li>
<li>
To retrieve the current values of output variables from EnergyPlus,
instantiate any number of
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.OutputVariable\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.OutputVariable</a> models.
</li>
<li>
To model an opaque construction such as a radiant slab in Modelica and interface
it to EnergyPlus, instantiate any number of
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.OpaqueConstruction\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.OpaqueConstruction</a> models.
</li>
<li>
To set individual surface temperatures in EnergyPlus and retrieve their room-side
heat gains, instantiate any number of
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ZoneSurface\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ZoneSurface</a> models.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have more than one building, you can repeat the above steps for each building and combine
these building models in a top-level model.
See for example
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Validation.MultipleBuildings.ThreeZonesTwoBuildings\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Validation.MultipleBuildings.ThreeZonesTwoBuildings</a>
for how to combine two buildings in one Modelica model.
</p>
<p>
For details of how to configure these models, see the information section of these models,
and look at the example models below.
</p>
<!-- Examples -->
<h4>Example models</h4>
<p>
To get started, we recommend to look at the simple examples in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse</a>
which illustrate the use of all these objects based on a single family house.
Also, read the information section of the models you plan to use in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0</a>.
</p>
<p>
We suggest looking at the examples in the following order which
starts with the simplest example and moves to more comprehensive ones.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.Unconditioned\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.Unconditioned</a> is modeling one
zone, the living room, in Modelica as an unconditioned zone with a fixed amount of outside air infiltration.
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.AirHeating\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.AirHeating</a>
adds an air-based heating system that recirculates air to track a heating setpoint temperature.
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.EquipmentSchedule\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.EquipmentSchedule</a>
shows how to set the equipment schedule in Modelica and override the schedule in EnergyPlus.
It also uses the unconditioned thermal zone to keep it simple.
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica//:Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.LightsControl\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.LightsControl</a>
is showing how to set the value of an EMS Actuator, here the one that sets internal gains
caused by the lights which are controlled by Modelica based on time of day and sun position.
The model also shows how to read an EnergyPlus output variable, here
for the lighting electricity consumption.
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.ShadeControl\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.ShadeControl</a>
reads from EnergyPlus the incident solar radiation, retrieves from the thermal zone its
temperature, and based on these values, actuates the window shading control
using an EMS actuator.
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.RadiantHeatingWithGroundHeatTransfer\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.RadiantHeatingWithGroundHeatTransfer</a>
illustrates how to couple a radiant slab for heating in a configuration in which the
bottom of the slab is connected to a ground heat transfer model in Modelica.
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.RadiantHeatingCooling_TSurface\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.RadiantHeatingCooling_TSurface</a>
and
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.RadiantHeatingCooling_TRoom\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.RadiantHeatingCooling_TRoom</a>
are similar to the previous model, but they add a radiant slab for cooling which interfaces
two surfaces in EnergyPlus: The floor that connects the slab to the zone above, and the ceiling
that connects the slab to the zone below.
In the first model, cooling is controlled based on the surface temperature, and in the second model, it is controlled
based on the room temperature.

<h4>Conventions</h4>
<p>
The following conventions are made:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If a zone is in the idf file but not modeled in Modelica, then
<ul>
<li>
EnergyPlus will simulate the zone as free floating, and
</li>
<li>
EnergyPlus will simulate the outside air infiltration if specified in the idf file.
</li>
</ul>
This allows unconditioned zones such as a basement or an attic to simulate in EnergyPlus
without having to use an instance of
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone</a>.
</li>
<li>
If a zone is in the idf file and modeled in Modelica using
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone</a>,
then EnergyPlus will remove all infiltration objects for this zone.
This is done because Modelica computes the mass balance of the zone air, and infiltration
depends on the static pressure of the HVAC system.
Pressure-driven infiltration can be modeled using
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Airflow.Multizone\">
Buildings.Airflow.Multizone</a>, or a fixed infiltration rate can be imposed as is shown in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.AirHeating\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.Examples.SingleFamilyHouse.AirHeating</a>.
</li>
<li>
All EnergyPlus HVAC objects that are present in the idf file are removed when coupled to Spawn.
</li>
<li>
Output variables and EMS actuators need not be present in the idf file.
</li>
<li>
For the EnergyPlus envelope, either the CTF transfer function or the finite difference
method can be used.
</li>
<li>
The coupling time step is determined by EnergyPlus based on the zone time step,
as declared in the idf file.
</li>
<li>
In EnergyPlus, a year of simulation always has 365 days, i.e., leap years are not considered.
This is done because in the Modelica Buildings Library, weather files are assumed to have a periodicity of 365 days.

      Documentation(
        info="<html>
<h4>EnergyPlus warm-up</h4>
<p>
In Spawn there can be both connected and unconnected zones defined in the EnergyPlus input file.
Connected zones have a corresponding zone model
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone\">
Buildings.ThermalZones.EnergyPlus_9_6_0.ThermalZone</a>
in Modelica that communicates with the EnergyPlus zone heat balance model.
Unconnected zones are thermal zones which are defined entirely within the EnergyPlus input file,
and for these zones the conventional EnergyPlus algorithms are used to simulate the zone conditions,
including the air temperature and humidity, which are free floating.
In contrast, for connected zones, Modelica models the temperature and humidity.
During the initialization of a new simulation it is necessary to compute initial values
for the zone air conditions as well as the conditions of any thermal mass, such as for walls, floors and ceilings.
Conventionally, EnergyPlus handles this requirement using a warmup period,
and in Spawn the traditional EnergyPlus warmup algorithm is employed
to initialize unconnected zones.
The EnergyPlus warmup algorithm is described in the
<a href=\"https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/9-3/engineering-reference/warmup-convergence.html#warmup-convergence\">
EnergyPlus Engineering Reference</a>, and summarized in the following steps.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Zone and wall surface temperatures are initialized to <i>23</i>&deg;C.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Zone humidity ratios are initialized to the outdoor conditions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
During warmup, the outdoor conditions are determined by the EnergyPlus weather file.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The first day of the simulation is repeated until warmup convergence,
which occurs when the minimum and maximum air temperatures during the warmup day
remain nearly the same between two successive iterations.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Spawn initializes unconnected zones using the warmup algorithm that was just described.
However, connected zones are treated differently than in a conventional EnergyPlus simulation
because initial zone air properties are specified in the Modelica zone model.
During Spawn warmup, the following steps occur:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
All wall surface temperatures are initialized to <i>23</i>&deg;C
just as they are in a conventional EnergyPlus warmup period.
However, as in EnergyPlus, during the warmup iterations,
the exterior walls will be subject to the ambient conditions defined by the weather file.
Therefore, exterior surface temperatures will not remain fixed at their <i>23</i>&deg;C
initial condition during the warmup process.
Similarly, room-facing wall surfaces will be exposed to the zone temperature, and
therefore approach a quasi-steady state at the conclusion of warmup.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The air temperatures of unconnected zones are initialized to <i>23</i>&deg;C.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The humidity ratios of unconnected zones are initialized to the outdoor conditions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The air temperatures and humidity ratios of connected zones are initialized to
the initial values defined in Modelica, and held fixed during the warmup period.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
During warmup, the outdoor conditions are determined by the EnergyPlus weather file
in the same way as a conventional EnergyPlus simulation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The first day of the simulation is repeated until the minimum and maximum air temperatures
during the warmup day remain nearly the same between two successive iterations.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Spawn warmup procedure is still invoked even if there are no unconnected zones defined in the model.
However, in this case the warmup convergence criteria will be met after only two iterations of the warmup day
because all zone temperature and humidity values are fixed to the initial values defined in Modelica.
It is possible for startup transients to still exist after Spawn warmup due thermal mass
in the wall materials not being fully exposed to the surface boundary conditions
defined by the outdoor environment and the initial zone air conditions.
A future enhancement may define a new warmup convergence criteria that takes into account
the internal wall temperatures.

This user guide describes how to use the EnergyPlus building envelope model
and exchange data during simulation between Modelica and EnergyPlus.
This allows to simulate HVAC and control systems in Modelica, coupled to
the EnergyPlus envelope model.
The implementation is such that the joint simulation between Modelica
and EnergyPlus is automatically setup, without the user having to configure
a co-simulation setup.
During the simulation, different data can be exchanged between Modelica and
EnergyPlus.
</p>
<p>

src=\"modelica://Buildings/Resources/Images/ThermalZones/EnergyPlus_9_6_0/envelope-room-hvac-1600.png\"/>
</p>
<p>
The figure above shows an overview of the exchanged coupling variables.
The coupling variables can connect Modelica thermal zone model with EnergyPlus envelope model, or Modelica
heat transfer models to EnergyPlus surfaces, for example to model a radiant floor.
They also allow reading the value of EnergyPlus output variables for use in Modelica-implemented
controllers, and writing to EnergyPlus schedules and EnergyPlus Energy Management System actuators.
This can be used, for instance, to send supervisory control signals to EnergyPlus, such as for
active facade control, or to control lights and equipment schedules that contribute
to heat gains in the room and its surfaces.
