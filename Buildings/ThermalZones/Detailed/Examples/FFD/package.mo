<p>
This package tests the coupled simulation of the model
<a href=\"Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed.CFD\">Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed.CFD</a> with the Fast Fluid Dynamics (FFD) program.
Different cases with various boundary conditions are evaluated.
The models in this package do not represent realistic buildings, but
are rather designed to test the coupled simulation.
