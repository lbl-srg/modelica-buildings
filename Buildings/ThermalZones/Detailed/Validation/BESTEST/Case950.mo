<p>
This model is used for the test case 950 of the BESTEST validation suite.
Case950 is the same as Case900, but with the following modifications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
From 1800 hours to 0700 hours, vent fan = on
</li>
<li>
From 0700 hours to 1800 hours, vent fan = off
</li>
<li>
Heating is always off
</li>
<li>
From 0700 hours to 1800 hours, cooling is on if zone temperature &gt; 27&deg;C,
otherwise cool = off.
</li>
<li>
From 1800 hours to 0700 hours, cooling is always off.
</li>
<li>
Ventilation fan capacity is 1703.16 standard m<sup>3</sup>/h (in addition to specified
infiltration rate).
</li>
<li>
No waste heat from fan.
</li>
</ul>
