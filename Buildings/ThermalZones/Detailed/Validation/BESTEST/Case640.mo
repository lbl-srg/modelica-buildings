<p>
This model is used for the basic test case 640 of the BESTEST validation suite.
Case640 is the same as Case600, but with the following modifications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
From 2300 hours to 0700 hours, heat = on if zone temperature is below 10&deg;C
</li>
<li>
From 0700 hours to 2300 hours, heat = on if zone temperature is above 20&deg;C
</li>
<li>
All hours, cool = on if zone temperature below 27&deg;C
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, mechanical equipment is off.
</li>
</ul>

end Case640;
