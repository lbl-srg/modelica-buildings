<p>
This model is the case 620 of the BESTEST validation suite.
Case 620 differs from case 600 in that the west and east facing walls
have a window, but there is no window in the south facing wall.

<li>
July 6, 2012, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Changed implementation to extend from Case 600, rather
than copying Case 600.
This better shows what is different relative to Case 600
as it avoid duplicate code.

<li>
May 12, 2012, by Kaustubh Phalak:<br/>
