    This is a model for the closet attached to test cell 3B in the LBNL User Facility.
    This documentation describes the wall constructions used in the closet. Documentation
    describing how it should be connected to other models in the package to form a
    complete model of test cell X3B can be found in
    <a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed.FLEXLAB.Rooms.X3B\">
    Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed.FLEXLAB.Rooms.X3B</a>.

    There are four different wall sections connected to the closet modeled here. They are shown
    in the figure below.
    </p>
    <p align=\"center\">

    </p>
    <p>
    The different wall sections are represented in the model according to the following table.
    </p>
    <table border = \"1\" summary = \"Wall sections in Closet model\">
    <tr>
    <th>Wall Section Number</th>

    There are two additional surfaces which are not included in the diagram. One is the model of the roof. It is
    modeled in datConExt[2] using the layer <code>roo</code>. The other is the floor, which is modeled in
    datConBou[3] using the layer <code>slaCon</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Several of the connections in this model are intended to be connected to specific surfaces in other room models.
    The following table describes the connections to models outside of the X3B package. The connections in datConExt
    are not described in the table because they are connected to the external environment, and no additional heat
    port connections are necessary. A rationale for why the model is created this way is also provided if it is
    considered necessary.
