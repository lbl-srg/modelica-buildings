  This is a model for test cell 3A in the LBNL User Facility. This model is intended to represent
  the main space in test cell 3A. This documentation describes the wall constructions used to model
  test cell X3A. Documentation describing how it is to be combined to other room models to create
  a model of the full test cell can be found in
  <a href=\"modelica://Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed.FLEXLAB.Rooms.X3A\">Buildings.ThermalZones.Detailed.FLEXLAB.Rooms.X3A</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are 7 different wall sections described in the model. They are shown in the figure below.

  The different wall sections are entered into the model according to the following table.

  An eigth construction, not shown in the figure, models the ceiling. It is modeled in datConExt[3] using
  the layer <code>R20Wal</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The test cell can be configured with several different floor types. The options include radiant conditioning,
  a slab on grade floor with no conditioning, or a raised floor. Because of this uncertainty in floor design, a
  model of the floor itself is not included in this model. The user must include a model for the floor in any
  applications of this model.
  </p>
  <p>
  Several of the connections in this model are intended to be connected to specific surfaces in other room models.
  The following table describes the connections to models outside of the X3A package. The connections in datConExt
  are not described in the table because they are connected to the external environment, and no additional heat
  port connections are necessary. A rationale for why the model is created this way is also provided if it is
  considered necessary.
