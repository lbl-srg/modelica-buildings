Model that uses EnergyPlus and sets the floor temperature to a constant value.
</p>
<p>
When simulated, the heat flow rate at the floor is often around <i>10..20</i> Watts.
However, it becomes negative when the direct solar irradiation is high, indicating that the
net heat flow rate is from the room into the construction due to the solar gains that hit the floor
even though the surface temperature is above the room air and room radiative temperature.
