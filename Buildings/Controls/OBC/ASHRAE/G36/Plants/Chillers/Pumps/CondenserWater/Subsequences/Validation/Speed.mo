This example validates
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Controls.OBC.ASHRAE.G36.Plants.Chillers.Pumps.CondenserWater.Subsequences.Speed\">

The example shows a chiller plant has 3 chiller stages and 6 plant stages. The plant
stage means the stage that considers both chiller stage and waterside economizer
status. The plant stage is specified by the parameter <code>staVec</code>, which
in this exmple is <code>{0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5}</code>. The element like <i>x.5</i>
means chiller stage x plus enabled waterside economizer.
At different plant stage, the number of enabled condenser water pumps and the speed
are specified by parameter <code>desConWatPumNum</code> (<code>{0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2}</code>)
and <code>desConWatPumSpe</code> (<code>{0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9}</code>).
</p>
<p>
The process of setting the condenser water pump speed and the pump number are
demonstrated as below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Before 0.2 seconds, the chiller stage is 0 and waterside economizer is enabled.
Thus, the plant stage is 0.5 (2nd stage), the number of enabled pumps is 1 and the
pump speed is 0.5.
</li>
<li>
In the period between 0.2 seconds and 0.375 seconds, the chiller stage is 1 and
waterside economizer is enabled. Thus, the plant stage is 1.5 (4th stage), the
number of enabled pumps is 2 and the pump speed is 0.6.
</li>
<li>
In the period between 0.375 seconds and 0.6 seconds, the chiller stage is 1 and
waterside economizer is disabled. Thus, the plant stage is 1 (3th stage), the
number of enabled pumps is 1 and the pump speed is 0.75.
</li>
<li>
In the period between 0.6 seconds and 0.75 seconds, the chiller stage is 2 and
waterside economizer is disabled. Thus, the plant stage is 2 (5th stage), the
number of enabled pumps is 2 and the pump speed is 0.75.
</li>
<li>
After 0.75 seconds, the chiller stage is 2 and waterside economizer is enabled. Thus,
the plant stage is 2.5 (6th stage), the number of enabled pumps is 2 and the pump
speed is 0.9.
