<p>
This package provides component models to compute heat conduction.
</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>
The package declares the constant <code>nSupPCM</code>,
which is equal to the number of support points that are used
to approximate the specific internal energy versus temperature relation.
This approximation is used by
<code>Buildings.HeatTransfer.Conduction.SingleLayer</code>
to replace the piece-wise linear function by a cubic hermite spline, with
linear extrapolation, in order to avoid state events during the simulation.
