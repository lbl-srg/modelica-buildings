<p>
This model describes the mass flow rate and pressure difference relation
of an orifice in the form
</p>
<p align=\"center\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">
  V = k sign(&Delta;p) |&Delta;p|<sup>m</sup>
</p>
<p>
where
<i>V</i> is the volume flow rate,
<i>k &gt; 0</i> is a flow coefficient
<i>&Delta; p</i> is the pressure drop and
<i>m &isin; [0.5, 1]</i> is a flow coefficient.
The equation is regularized for
<i>|&Delta;p| &lt; &Delta;p<sub>t</sub></i>, where
<i>&Delta;p<sub>t</sub></i> is a parameter.
For turbulent flow, set <i>m=1 &frasl; 2</i> and
for laminar flow, set <i>m=1</i>.
</p>
<p>
The model is used for the interzonal air flow models.
</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>
For <i>|&Delta;p| &lt; &Delta;p<sub>t</sub></i>, the equation is regularized
so that it is twice continuously differentiable in <i>&Delta;p</i>, and that it
has an infinite number of continuous derivatives in <i>m</i> and in <i>k</i>.
</p>
<p>
If <i>m</i> is not a function of time, then
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> can be pre-computed.
In this situation, use
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.BaseClasses.powerLawFixedM\">
Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.BaseClasses.powerLawFixedM</a>, which allows
to compute these values outside of this function, for example as parameters
of a model.
