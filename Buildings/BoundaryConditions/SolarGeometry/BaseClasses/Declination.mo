<p>
This component computes the solar declination, which is
the angle between the equatorial plane and the solar beam.
The input signal <code>nDay</code> is the one-based number of the day, but in seconds.
Hence, during January 1, we should have <code>nDay = 86400</code> seconds.
Since the effect of using a continuous number rather than an integer is small,
we approximate this so that <code>nDay = 0</code> at the start of January 1,
and <code>nDay = 86400</code> at the end of January 1.
