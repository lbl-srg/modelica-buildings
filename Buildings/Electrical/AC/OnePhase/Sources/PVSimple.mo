<p>
Model of a simple photovoltaic array.
</p>
<p>
The electrical connector is an AC interface.
</p>
<p>
This model computes the active power as
<p align=\"center\" style=\"font-style:italic;\">
P=A &nbsp; f<sub>act</sub> &nbsp; &eta; &nbsp; G &nbsp; &eta;<sub>DCAC</sub>,
</p>
<p>
where <i>A</i> is the panel area,
<i>f<sub>act</sub></i> is the fraction of the aperture area,
<i>&eta;</i> is the panel efficiency,
<i>G</i> is the total solar irradiation, which is the
sum of direct and diffuse irradiation, and
<i>&eta;<sub>DCAC</sub></i> is the efficiency of the conversion
between DC and AC.
</p>
<p>
This active power is equal to <i>P</i>,
while the reactive power is equal to <i>Q = P &nbsp; tan(acos(pf)) </i>
where <i>pf</i> is the power factor.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This model takes as input the total solar irradiation on the panel.
This has to be computed converting the incoming radiation to take tilt and azimuth into account.
For a model that implements this conversion, use
