This connector represents a generalized electric terminal. The generalization is made possible by the
replaceable package <a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Electrical.Interfaces.Terminal.PhaseSystem\">
Buildings.Electrical.Interfaces.Terminal.PhaseSystem</a>.
The package <code>PhaseSystem</code> can be one of the packages contained in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Electrical.PhaseSystems\">
Buildings.Electrical.PhaseSystems</a>.
Using this approach allows to represent DC, single phase AC and
multi phases balanced and unbalanced AC systems with the same connector.
</p>
<p>
This connector is compatible with the following Modelica libraries:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://www.modelon.com/products/modelica-libraries/electric-power-library\">
Electric Power Library</a>
developed by Modelon, and
</li>
<li>
<a href=\"https://github.com/modelica/PowerSystems\">Power Systems Library</a>
developed by <a href=\"mailto:Ruediger.Franke@de.abb.com\">Ruediger Franke</a> (ABB).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The connector is overdetermined since the number of effort variables
is higher than the number of flow variables.
This happens when the phase system has a number of reference angles
<code>PhaseSystem.m &gt; 0</code>.
The over-determined connectors are defined and used in such a way
that a Modelica tool is able
to remove the superfluous but consistent equations arriving
at a balanced set of equations, based on a
graph analysis of the connection structure.
The models have to use ad-hoc constructs specified by the Modelica language to handle this situation.
