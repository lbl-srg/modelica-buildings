<p>
This model is the linearized version of the model
<a href=\"Buildings.Electrical.DC.Lines.Examples.DCLines\">
Buildings.Electrical.DC.Lines.Examples.DCLines</a> and
can be used to test how the linearized loads are affected by the voltage drop
caused by the lines. The longer the distance between the load and the source,
the bigger is the voltage drop and thus the error introduced by the linearization.
