This package contains examples and tutorials with step-by-step instructions
for how to build system models.

The examples illustrate
the scope of the library. Smaller examples that typically only
use models from a few packages can be found in the individual packages.
For example, see
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.Examples\">
Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.Examples</a> for examples of
multizone airflow and contaminant transport models, or
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Fluid.HeatExchangers.Examples\">
Buildings.Fluid.HeatExchangers.Examples</a> for
examples of heat exchanger models.
