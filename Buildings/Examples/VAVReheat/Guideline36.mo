<p>
This model consist of an HVAC system, a building envelope model and a model
for air flow through building leakage and through open doors.
</p>
<p>
The HVAC system is a variable air volume (VAV) flow system with economizer
and a heating and cooling coil in the air handler unit. There is also a
reheat coil and an air damper in each of the five zone inlet branches.
</p>
<p>
See the model
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.PartialHVAC\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.PartialHVAC</a>
for a description of the HVAC system,
and see the model
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Floor\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Floor</a>
for a description of the building envelope.
</p>
<p>
The control is based on ASHRAE Guideline 36, and implemented
using the sequences from the library
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Controls.OBC.ASHRAE.G36_PR1\">
Buildings.Controls.OBC.ASHRAE.G36_PR1</a> for
multi-zone VAV systems with economizer. The schematic diagram of the HVAC and control
sequence is shown in the figure below.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<img alt=\"image\" src=\"modelica://Buildings/Resources/Images/Examples/VAVReheat/vavControlSchematics.png\" border=\"1\"/>
</p>
<p>
A similar model but with a different control sequence can be found in
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006</a>.
Note that this model, because of the frequent time sampling,
has longer computing time than
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006</a>.
The reason is that the time integrator cannot make large steps
because it needs to set a time step each time the control samples
its input.

Refactored model to implement the economizer dampers directly in
<code>Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.PartialHVAC</code> rather than through the
model of a mixing box. Since the version of the Guideline 36 model has no exhaust air damper,
this leads to simpler equations.
