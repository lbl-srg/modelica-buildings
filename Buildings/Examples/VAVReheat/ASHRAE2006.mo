<p>
This model consist of an HVAC system, a building envelope model and a model
for air flow through building leakage and through open doors.
</p>
<p>
The HVAC system is a variable air volume (VAV) flow system with economizer
and a heating and cooling coil in the air handler unit. There is also a
reheat coil and an air damper in each of the five zone inlet branches.
The figure below shows the schematic diagram of the HVAC system

</p>
<p>
See the model
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.PartialHVAC\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.PartialHVAC</a>
for a description of the HVAC system,
and see the model
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Floor\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Floor</a>
for a description of the building envelope.
</p>
<p>
The control is an implementation of the control sequence
<i>VAV 2A2-21232</i> of the Sequences of Operation for
Common HVAC Systems (ASHRAE, 2006). In this control sequence, the
supply fan speed is modulated based on the duct static pressure.
The return fan controller tracks the supply fan air flow rate.
The duct static pressure set point is adjusted so that at least one
VAV damper is 90% open.
The heating coil valve, outside air damper, and cooling coil valve are
modulated in sequence to maintain the supply air temperature set point.
The economizer control provides the following functions:
freeze protection, minimum outside air requirement, and supply air cooling,
see
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Controls.Economizer\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Controls.Economizer</a>.
The controller of the terminal units tracks the room air temperature set point
based on a \"dual maximum with constant volume heating\" logic, see
<a href=\"modelica://Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Controls.RoomVAV\">
Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.Controls.RoomVAV</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is also a finite state machine that transitions the mode of operation
of the HVAC system between the modes
<i>occupied</i>, <i>unoccupied off</i>, <i>unoccupied night set back</i>,
<i>unoccupied warm-up</i> and <i>unoccupied pre-cool</i>.
In the VAV model, all air flows are computed based on the
duct static pressure distribution and the performance curves of the fans.
Local loop control is implemented using proportional and proportional-integral
controllers, while the supervisory control is implemented
using a finite state machine.

Refactored model to implement the economizer dampers directly in
<code>Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.BaseClasses.PartialHVAC</code> rather than through the
model of a mixing box. Since the version of the Guideline 36 model has no exhaust air damper,
this leads to simpler equations.<br/>
