<p>
This is a model of a connection with a two-pipe distribution network using 
a plug flow pipe model that includes pressure drop, heat transfer, and transport
delays.
</p>
<p>
The plug flow pipe model is used in the main distribution line,
but not in the connection to the building, as the latter is typically short.
